Here I have created a mini project of ATM using C++.
So this mini project is going to consist of ATM functionalities implimented using OOP concepts.
The functionalities are: 
* Check balance: The user can check the account balance.
* Cash WithDraw: User can Withdraw cash from the ATM, but the only condition is
user must enter the valid input, like the amount to be withdraw should be less than account balance.
* User Details: User can see and cross check  details with bank.
* Update Mobile no. :The user can update mobile number linked to the bank account.
